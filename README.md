# Discontinued
The new C++ version is available here: https://github.com/Nyre221/Kiview  
## Reasons for Discontinuing the Project

With the new C++ version I see no reason to continue the python version and furthermore, this version is probably subject to the injection of malicious bash commands via the file name.  
QuickView doesn't appear to be affected by the same command as Kiview but is likely affected in other ways: https://github.com/Nyre221/Kiview/issues/5 



# dolphin-quick-view
Simple program to have a quick preview of the files in a folder (similar to Apple's Quick Look)

## Supported files: 

txt,mp3,mp4,jpg,png,webp,svg,svgz,doc,docx,odt,xls,xlsx,csv,ods,odp,ppt,pptx,md,pdf,zip,rar,tar.gz,tar.xz,kra

## Installation:
1: Download the latest release from here and extract it: https://github.com/Nyre221/dolphin-quick-view/releases/

2: Install the requirements: https://github.com/Nyre221/dolphin-quick-view/tree/main/Requirements

3: Make the "INSTALL.sh" file executable (right click-> properties->check "executable") and run it

4: If you want to open it with a shortcut and not just via dolphin's context menu:
go to plasma settings -> shortcuts -> add a shortcut that executes a command: /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.config/quick_view/dolphin_quick_view_shortcut.sh 

(you can activate the shortcut as you want)


## Common Quick view shortcuts:
a,d and arrow keys (right/left) = back and forward  
arrow keys (down/up) = scroll  
spacebar, q and ESC = quit  
"w" and return key = open with default app   


## Debug:
If quick view doesn't open via dolphin's dropdown menu:
open a terminal and type "dolphin", error messages will appear in the terminal window (possible missing dependencies)

alternatively you can use this command: `~/.config/quick_view/quick_view.pyz /path/to/some/file -s`

if dolphin_quick_view_shortcut.sh doesn't work, run: "sleep 5 ; ~/.config/quick_view/dolphin_quick_view_shortcut.sh" in a terminal and reactivate a dolphin window (you have 5 seconds).
The errors should appear there.

if the pdfs are not visible it is because you have not installed python3-qpageview or python3-poppler-qt5 (names may differ a bit)

if some mp4 files don't play it's probably because you're missing some gstreamer library


## How you can help:
I created a module called "example_module.py", download it and try to create a new viewer.  
The module can be run separately and you don't need to download all the project files.  
To start using it you just need to install python-pyqt5 for your distro: https://github.com/Nyre221/dolphin-quick-view/tree/main/Requirements
